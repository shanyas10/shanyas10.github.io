		<b>Peer-to-peer AI-based tracing of COVID-19</b><br>
		Contributed to the simulator of Peer-to-Peer AI Tracing App delegated by Prof. Yoshua Bengio. The simulator simulates human mobility along with COVID-19 spreading in a city, while considering a city to consist of houses, grocery stores, parks, workplaces, and other non-essential establishments. Contributed on simulating mobility by simulating number of houses, stores, parks in a city. (Please note that my github handle, mentioned as @thechange in the repository, has been changed to @shanyas10).<br>

		<b>Using Affective Computing to analyze YouTube watching history to detect depression</b><br>
		The project is based on the theory Misery loves company, i.e. in misery we tend to consume content such as music, literature etc. that we relate to. It is aimed at calculation of affective scores of videos using the audio visual feature and further analyzing the affective pattern generated from the YouTube watching history of an individual to predict his depression severity score.<br>

		<b>Detection of fake news during disasters</b><br>
		False and incorrect information during disasters can lead to chaos and panic among people on the ground and have serious detrimental outcomes for public safety.In this project, I developed a multi-modal model using BiLSTM-CHarCNN and VGG 16 that can detect the credibility of a post by effectively capturing the semantics of the text along with the features of associated piece of multimedia in it.<br>

	</li><br>
	<li>
		<b>Extractive Summarizer</b><br>
		Developed an extraction based document summarizing application which automatically summarizes the text given by choosing the important sentences in the document.Used Naive Bayes classifierto train the model using certain statistical features- based on the frequency of some elements in text and linguistic features- based on the structure of text(length and position).<br>

		<b>Real-time facial emotion detector</b><br>
		(Major project for B.E. final year)
		Developed a facial emotion classifier using SVM to classify a facial expression as happy, sad or surprised with an accuracy of 73%. Used Viola Jones Algorithm for facial detection and Local Binary Patterns(LBP) for feature extraction. Cohn-Kanade dataset for training and evaluation purpose. To test the out-of-domain accuracy, an additional evaluation dataset of 100 images by capturing facial expressions of 5 volunteers. OOD accuracy came out to be 68%. Integrated with Arduino UNO to capture the output signal from MATLAB and display the detected emotion on 16x2 LCD<br>
