<h1>Hi!</h1>
<br><br>I'm Shanya and this is where you can find information regarding my academic life. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing, preferably Natural Language Undertsanding. My ideal research project is one which has a potential to make an advancement in technology while also creating a large scale impact towards the society.<br><br>
Currently I work as a Senior Software Developer at Walmart Labs India where I am responsible for the development of backend services for Walmart store associates across the world. Prior to this I worked as a Developer Associate at SAP Labs and as a Research Intern at IIIT Jabalpur. <br><br>

Parallely, I have also been pursuing my research interests. You can find a list of my publications and other research projects under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab.

I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p> You can also find my detailed cv <a href = "/cv"> here</a><br> <br>
