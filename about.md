I work as a Senior Software Developer at Walmart Labs where I develop services to ease the lives of Walmart Store Associates across the world. Prior to this, I was a Developer Associate at SAP Labs India where I worked on development of microservices for management of test data across various S4 systems. I was also responsible for development of intelligent solutions for quality assurance. In my tenure of around 2 years at SAP I've been a part of various innovation activities and have filed Invention Disclosure Forms to patent various ideas.

I like to work in the area of Natural Language Processing and I have a belief that technology is a superpower we have endowed ourselves with so I can often be found researching on social issues while trying to find a solution to them using AI (preferably NLP). I also co- founded a startup TAFLE where which focused on enabling circular economy by bringing recyclers, collection partners and manufacturers on the same platform. The idea was amongst one of the 5 finalists at SAP 1 Billion Lives APJ round.

I like to put my brain to work by solving puzzles, playing chess and occassionally spending my time on <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/users/thechange"> codechef</a>. I've realized I am my truest self when I am cocooned in the blanket of emotions that overwhelm me when I am <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51522882-shanya-sharma">reading, </a>/<a href = "/poetry_essay/poetry/">writing</a> or watching animes!!!
